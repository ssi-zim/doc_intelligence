# Doc Intelligence

Free, open-source, self-hosted AI-powered document analysis and ERPNext automation for Frappe / ERPNext. No plans, no limits — every feature is always on for every user.

Upload a PDF, DOCX, or photo and instantly get an AI-generated summary, key entity extraction, table parsing, and unlimited Q&A. Then go further — create draft ERPNext records (Item, Supplier, Customer, Employee, Address, Quotation, Sales Order, Purchase Order, Material Request) directly from the document, or turn a supplier invoice into a draft Purchase Invoice complete with independent financial validation, fuzzy supplier matching, and duplicate-invoice detection.

Everything is self-hosted: your documents and your API keys stay on your own Frappe site. Bring your own keys for whichever LLM providers you want — Groq, Gemini, Cerebras, OpenRouter, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenAI, or Claude — with automatic fallback between them.

## Features

**Document intelligence**
- Analyses PDF, DOCX, and image files (JPG/PNG/WEBP/GIF via AI-based OCR)
- Automatic summary, key entities/parties, dates, amounts, and clauses
- Extracts and renders tabular data (e.g. invoice line items) found in documents
- Answers free-text questions about any uploaded document
- Compares two documents side-by-side
- In-browser camera capture — single photo or multi-page (auto-combined into one PDF), from both the portal and the Desk form

**ERPNext automation**
- Create draft Item / Supplier / Customer / Employee / Address records from a document, with fuzzy duplicate matching (exact-then-fuzzy string similarity, refuses to auto-pick when multiple records are ambiguously close)
- Create draft Quotation / Sales Order / Purchase Order / Material Request from a document, with the same party-matching plus independent recalculation of line-item totals against the AI-reported total
- Create a draft Purchase Invoice from a supplier invoice, with:
  - Independent financial validation — recalculates subtotal/tax/grand total from extracted line items and flags a mismatch beyond a 2% tolerance
  - Fuzzy supplier matching with ambiguity detection
  - Duplicate invoice detection (same bill number + supplier), with a hard server-side block unless explicitly confirmed

**Ask ERPNext — plain-English queries, safely**
- Desk page (`Ask ERPNext`) to ask natural-language questions about your ERP data
- Schema-aware planning: the AI plans against real DocType metadata, not guessed fields
- Structured JSON query plans, validated against an explicit allow-list before anything runs
- Permission-safe reads via `frappe.get_list()` as the current user — no `ignore_permissions`, no raw SQL, no generated Python
- Optional draft record creation (Customer, Supplier, Item, Task, ToDo, Contact, Lead) with an explicit on-screen **Approve / Cancel** step — nothing is written until you approve
- Demo prompts for quick screenshots or a first try: *"Show unpaid invoices older than 30 days"*, *"Show low-stock items"*, *"How many sales orders were created this week?"*, and more
- Full audit trail of every question, plan, and outcome in **DI Copilot Log**

**Platform**
- Multi-provider LLM routing with automatic fallback, so a rate-limited provider doesn't block processing
- Provider health dashboard (24h success rate per provider)
- Full REST API for integration with external systems
- PWA — installable, with offline document-list caching

## Architecture

Classic Frappe custom app + decoupled Vue 3 SPA:

- **Backend** (`doc_intelligence/doc_intelligence/`) — DocTypes, whitelisted REST API (`api/__init__.py`), the multi-provider LLM engine (`llm_engine.py`), the financial-validation/fuzzy-matching module (`validation.py`), and the Ask ERPNext planner/validator/executor (`copilot.py`).
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`) — Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router + Dexie (PWA offline cache), built to `doc_intelligence/public/doc_intelligence_app/` and served at `/doc-intelligence`.
- Legacy Desk Pages (`di-dashboard`, `di-provider-settings`) work alongside the SPA if you prefer working from inside Desk.

See `DEPLOY.md` for build/deploy steps.

## Installation

```bash
bench get-app doc_intelligence https://github.com/aravindsprint/doc_intelligence
bench --site yoursite.localhost install-app doc_intelligence
bench --site yoursite.localhost migrate
pip install openai anthropic pypdf python-docx --break-system-packages
cd apps/doc_intelligence/frontend && yarn install && yarn build
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench build --app doc_intelligence
bench restart
```

## First-Time Setup

1. Go to `/doc-intelligence/provider-settings` (System Manager only)
2. Expand a provider and paste in an API key — Groq, Gemini, Cerebras, Mistral, and DeepSeek all have usable free tiers
3. Click **Save Settings** → **Test All Providers**
4. Add that provider's id to **Enabled Providers**, e.g. `groq,gemini,cerebras,claude`
5. Go to `/doc-intelligence/home` → **Upload Document**
6. Wait for status = **Ready**, then try Ask a Question, Compare, and Create ERPNext Record
7. In Desk, open **Ask ERPNext** (search bar or the Doc Intelligence workspace) and try one of the demo prompts, e.g. *"Show unpaid invoices"*
